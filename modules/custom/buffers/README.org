#+title: Buffers

Emacs buffers are similar to what other systems might call a *file*, *document*,
*workspace* or *editor*.

Highlights of this buffer configuration:

- Add function =bk/indent-whole-buffer=
- Add function =bk/diff-current-buffer-with-file=
- Add function =bk/switch-to-message-buffer=
