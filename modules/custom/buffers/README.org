#+title: Buffers

Emacs buffers are similar to what other systems might call a *file*, *document*,
*workspace* or *editor*.

Buffers can contain text and images.

Buffers are shown in windows on the screen.

Buffers can be displayed in more than one window at a time, or it might not be
displayed at all.


* Main changes

I like how Doom treats buffers. For now, my only changes are solely based on
adding more functions and keybindings.


My custom functions:

- =bk/indent-whole-buffer=
- =bk/diff-current-buffer-with-file=
- =bk/switch-to-message-buffer=
