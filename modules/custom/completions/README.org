#+title: Completions

I settled with =consult=, =vertico=, =embark=, and =company= combo to handle
completions.

I really don't like automatic completions because I feel they slow down Emacs a
lot. Also, it is inconvenient to type a few letters and have a big list of
options poping up every time with candidates. I find this very distractive.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq company-idle-delay nil)
#+end_src

Allow me to have completions only when I want it..

#+begin_src elisp
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
#+end_src

Will make the completion list popup from the bottom every time I hit TAB.

Simple and enough for me.
