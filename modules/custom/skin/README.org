#+title: Skin - Look and Feels

Settings about how my Emacs instance looks like.

Interesting fact about me: I usually run in the default white theme and default
font. I try to find nice themes and good fonts, but is very hard for me to
commit with any of them.

And the reason is interesting, I don't have any data to back this up however, I
am pretty sure *any* font I set made my Emacs slower than default font and *any*
theme I load (I'm lying.. =zenburn= seems faster in fact) made my Emacs slower
too.

Please, change my mind!
