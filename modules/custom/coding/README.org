#+title: General Coding Settings

Always hard to tell what should go here in general settings or in a specific layer for the programming language most affected by that change. For now, the code restrict itself to disable automatic syntax checking on Flycheck and some small details that annoys me in general.

Highlights of this coding configuration:

- Add function =bk/flycheck-list-errors=
- Disable Flycheck automatic checkers
