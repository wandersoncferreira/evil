#+title: General Coding Settings

Always hard to tell what should go here in general settings or in a specific
layer for the programming language most affected by that change.

For now, the code restrict itself to disable automatic syntax checking on
Flycheck and some small details that annoys me in general.


* Main changes

- =bk/flycheck-list-errors=
- Disable Flycheck automatic checkers
