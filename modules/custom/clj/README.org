#+title: Clojure

My day-to-day job involves coding in Clojure for most of the time.

Therefore, as I find some opportunity to improve my daily workflow I often add
or remove elisp code in here. Very volatile config ahead!


* Main changes

- Change cider modeline indicator (=autoload.el/bk/cider--modeline-info=)
- Save buffers after running tests
- Tame test and REPL buffers
