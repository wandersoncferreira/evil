#+title: Work

This package will contain several functions tailored to my work.

I work at Cisco now, therefore only Cisco functions will be available here.

The functions are bound to =SPC j= prefix .. this is a very good restriction to
have only one work at a time. :)

The code itself of these functions are behind a private repo called
=emacs-at-work=.
