* Description

Custom implementation of [[https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon][Harpoon]] Vim Plugin.

Usually when we work coding some functionality there are few important files we
care about. Perhaps 1, 2, 3, .. 5. Idk. Usually less than 5. But we jump to a lot
of auxiliary files to read something, to check some assumptions, or whatnot.
Then we want to get back to one of our important files.

This is how harpoon works:
- by project
- set harpoon: 1 to 5 important files using ~SPC + h + {!, @, #, $, %}~ (notice, 1 to 5 + shift)
- jump to harpoon using ~SPC + h + {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}~

If you want to clear all harpoons from current project call ~M-x bk/harpoon-clean-project~
