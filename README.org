#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration

My first configuration files using Doom Emacs with Evil mode enabled.

So far, enjoying a lot. I'm documenting all the learning process in the =docs/=
folder. After 10 years of standard Emacs keybindings, this was a big jump and a
great level of frustration for the first two weeks.


Enjoy and be patient if traveling the same waters.


* Documentation

Lots of resources to learn *Evil* and *Doom* in the =docs/= folder. [[file:docs/README.org][Follow for
more.]]
