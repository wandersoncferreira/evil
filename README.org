#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration

My first configuration files using Doom Emacs with Evil mode enabled.

So far, enjoying a lot. I'm documenting all the learning process in the =docs/=
folder. After 10 years of standard Emacs keybindings, this was a big jump and a
great level of frustration for the first two weeks.

Enjoy and be patient if traveling the same waters.

[[file:docs/README.org][Learn more about Doom and Evil]]

* Documentation for the little voice on your shoulder!

One thing I feared the most about Emacs Frameworks was installing lots of
functionality that I'd never know about because I haven't explicitly added them.

This is definitely bothering me on my current Doom instalation, but before going
to the self-degradation "do-it-yourself because I can" route,  let me try
something new.

I will document every aspect of Doom as I discover about it so I can get
familiar with what's around. Basically, reading elisp code and removing packages
that I don't like or know what it is doing.

** Doom CORE
Doom is basically divided into ~core~ and ~modules~ at a very high level. All
the code in ~core~ are related to sane defaults, Doom's foundation on package
management, projects, and a feel more pieces.

These are some packages of my interest:
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/d6d1e600c0b22ce323558002eccdaac6edbcf2b2/core/core-projects.el#L22][projectile]]
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-keybinds.el#L214][which-key]]
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-editor.el#L713][ws-butler]]
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-editor.el#L585][smartparens]]

These are some packages that I want to remove because I don't care at all about them:
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-ui.el#L481][highlight-numbers]]
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-ui.el#L438][all-the-icons]]
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-editor.el#L527][helpful]]
- restart-emacs

These are the ones I removed but I'm still judging if I'll miss them or not:
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-editor.el#L429][better-jumper]]

** Doom MODULES
I'll follow the order from ~init.el~ file.

*** company
Only company is installed. Victory! The defaults are nice.

*** STARTED vertico
Packages that I'm interesting in keeping & learning:
- [ENABLED] [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]]
  - also enabled ~vertico-multiform-mode~ for project-wide searches
- [ENABLED] [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]]
  - It is possible to live without orderless and configuring ~completion-styles~ option to consider ~partial-completion~ and ~flex~, however ~orderless~ is a lot faster than this option. Let's keep it around.
  - Amazing! I learned how to use ~orderless~ in company completion UI. As ~SPC~ takes us out of completion, let's use ~&~ as the separator.
- [OFF] consult
- [OFF] consult-dir
- [OFF] consult-flycheck
- [OFF] embark
- [OFF] embark-consult
- [OFF] wgrep

However, I'll enable each of them only after I make significant effort to
understand their value proposition and how they fit into my workflow in Emacs.

Packages removed that I might miss someday:
- consult-dir
- marginalia

*** doom
Nothing here to see. Packages removed:
- doom-themes
- solaire-mode

*** TODO popup
Very amazing package developed by Doom team. I'm very interested in digging
deeper here. Taming popup has been one of my worst skills in Emacs.

I enabled ~+all~ special buffers to be handled as popups. Very optimistic about this.

*** TODO vc-gutter
Only [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/f913ff07b3a63d57ca0de48037e9098f0a598791/modules/ui/vc-gutter/config.el#L22][git-gutter]] is instealled. Victory! The defaults are nice.

*** TODO hl-todo
Only [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/f913ff07b3a63d57ca0de48037e9098f0a598791/modules/ui/hl-todo/config.el#L3][hl-todo]] is instealled. Victory! The defaults are nice.
