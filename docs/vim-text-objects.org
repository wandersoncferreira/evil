#+title: Vim Text Objects

Vim provides text objects for the three building blocks of plaintext: words,
sentences, and paragraphs.

Vim's text objects provides an incredible level of precison, the key is to try
to always edit by text objects.

- =aw= - a word (includes surrounding white space)
- =iw= - inner word (does not include surrounding white space)
- =it= - xml/html tag (applies to everything in current xml/html tag)

This convention about the =a= and =i= is followed by all text objects.

- =as= - a sentence
- =is= - inner sentence
- =ap= - a paragraph
- =ip= - inner paragraph

* Programming language text objects

Vim provides several text objects based on common programming language
constructs.

| Command | Description                                         |
| a"      | a double quoted string                              |
| i"      | inner double quoted string                          |
| a)      | a parenthesized block                               |
| i)      | inner parenthesized block                           |
| i{      | inner  nearest curly brackets                       |
| ai      | a indentation block                                 |
| ii      | inner indentation                                   |
