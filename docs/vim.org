#+title: Vim

Vim is fundammentally built on command composability.

Vim favors small, general-purpose commands that can be combined with objects to
compose larger commands.

* General recommendations:
- use the more general text objects (~iw~ rather than ~w~)
- prefer text objects over motions when possible
  - words: ~w~
  - sentences: ~s~
  - paragraph: ~p~
  - double quoted string: ~"~
  - parenthesized block: ~)~
  - indentation block: ~i~
- visual mode is a smell because it breaks repeatability
- don't use two sentences where one will do it
- to avoid using Esc we can press ~C-[~ or ~jk~ in Doom
- history of past searches: ~q/~
- ~ctrl-^~ will send you back to the previous buffer you were in
- ~gn~ for the next occurrence of the last used search pattern
- always be scrolling! don't use ~hjkl~ to move around the screen
