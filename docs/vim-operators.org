#+title: Vim Operators

The following operators are available:

| Command | Description                                    |
|---------+------------------------------------------------|
| c       | change                                         |
| d       | delete                                         |
| y       | yank into register                             |
| ~       | swap case                                      |
| g~      | swap case                                      |
| gu      | make lowercase                                 |
| gU      | make uppercase                                 |
| !       | filter through an external program             |
| =       | filter through C-indenting                     |
| gq      | text formatting                                |
| >       | shift right                                    |
| <       | shift left                                     |
| zf      | define a fold                                  |

If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a count before it, then
the two counts are multiplied. For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.

* Insert Mode Shotcuts

When editing a file in Insert Mode, many shortcuts used elsewhere in Unix and
other text editors are available.

| Command      | Description                                    |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl-w       | delete the word before the cursor              |
| Ctrl-u       | delete the current line                        |
| Ctrl-[       | quits insert mode and goes back to Normal mode |
| Ctrl-r {reg} | paste text from register                       |
| Ctrl-n       | invoke Vim's auto completion                   |
| Ctrl-p       | invoke Vim's auto completion                   |
