#+title: Vim Operators

The following operators are available:

| Command | Description                           |
|---------+---------------------------------------|
| c       | change                                |
| d       | delete                                |
| y       | yank into register                    |
| ~       | swap case                             |
| g~      | swap case                             |
| gu      | make lowercase                        |
| gU      | make uppercase                        |
| !       | filter through an external program    |
| =       | filter through C-indenting            |
| ==      | indent the current line               |
| gq      | text formatting                       |
| >       | shift right                           |
| <       | shift left                            |
| zf      | define a fold                         |
| d])     | delete until the next close parens    |
| M-d     | iedit select the current word forward |
| M-D     | iedit select the next word backward   |

If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a count before it, then
the two counts are multiplied. For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.

* Insert Mode Shotcuts

When editing a file in Insert Mode, many shortcuts used elsewhere in Unix and
other text editors are available.

| Command      | Description                                    |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl-w       | delete the word before the cursor              |
| Ctrl-u       | delete the current line                        |
| Ctrl-[       | quits insert mode and goes back to Normal mode |
| Ctrl-r {reg} | paste text from register                       |
| Ctrl-n       | invoke Vim's auto completion                   |
| Ctrl-p       | invoke Vim's auto completion                   |

* The ex command g

The ex command =g= is very useful for acting on lines that match a pattern. You
can use it with the =d= command to delete all lines that contain a particular
pattern.

=:g/pattern/d=
