| ~       | swap case                                      |
| g~      | swap case                                      |
| gu      | make lowercase                                 |
| gU      | make uppercase                                 |
| !       | filter through an external program             |
| =       | filter through C-indenting                     |
| gq      | text formatting                                |
| g?      | ROT13 encoding                                 |
| >       | shift right                                    |
| <       | shift left                                     |
| zf      | define a fold                                  |
| g@      | call function set with the operatorfunc option |

If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a count before it, then
the two counts are multiplied. For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.
