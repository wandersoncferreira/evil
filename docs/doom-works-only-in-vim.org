#+title: Doom Works Only In Vim

Works in Vim, but seems not to work on Doom

- [ ] Global marks are preserved between sessions in Vim
- [ ] :help <doc-entry> ---- Vim docs not available :/
- [ ] :changes doesn't work
- [X] =[I= show lines with matching word under cursor
  - now, this binding will call =+vertico/search-symbol-at-point= function which
    is an improvement over Vim's default behavior due to interactivity
- [ ] the commands ='[=, and =']= does not work.
  - These are marks defined by Vim to jump to last yank/changed text
  - we can use ~goto-last-change~ or ~g;~ command though
