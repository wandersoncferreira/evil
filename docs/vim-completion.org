#+title: Vim Completion

There is a nice table summarizing the Vim completion functionalities implemented
in Doom:

| Command | Description                       |
|---------+-----------------------------------|
| C-x C-f | complete file path                |
| C-x C-l | complete full line                |
| C-x C-o | invoke complete-at-point function |
| C-x C-p | complete previous symbol at point |
| C-x C-s | complete snippet                  |
| C-w     | erase the last inserted word      |
| C-u     | erase the last inserted line      |
| C-x s   | complete spelling suggestions     |

There's yet a simple completion in any text by hit =Ctrl-n= in insert mode.
There is also a backward search using =Ctrl-p=.
