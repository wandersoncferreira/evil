1. Combine d, c, or y with ~/~ to operate on text up until a ~pattern~ match:
   - ~d/foo~  delete forward untill ~foo~
   - ~c/\d~ change forward until the next number

2. navigate more efficiently by using jumps
   - ~ctrl-o~ moves backwards through the jump list
   - ~ctrl-i~ moves forwards through the jump list

3. removes lines matching a pattern with the ~g~ command
   - ~:g/pattern/d~ remove lines matching pattern
   - ~:g!/pattern/d~ remove lines that do NOT match
