1. combine d, c, or y with ~/~ to operate on text up until a ~pattern~ match:
   - ~d/foo~  delete forward untill ~foo~
   - ~c/\d~ change forward until the next number

2. navigate more efficiently by using jumps
   - ~ctrl-o~ moves backwards through the jump list
   - ~ctrl-i~ moves forwards through the jump list

3. removes lines matching a pattern with the ~g~ command
   - ~:g/pattern/d~ remove lines matching pattern
   - ~:g!/pattern/d~ remove lines that do NOT match

4. delete without overwriting your last yank
   - use the black hole register `_`
   - ~"_daw~ delete a word

 5. the 0 register will contain your most recent yank
    - ~"0p~ put the yanked word before a delete

6. use ~10@a~ to play the macro saved in register ~a~ 10 times

7. use ~ea~ to append to the end of the current word

8. use ~(~ and ~)~ to jump to the beginning and end of sentences

9. scroll current line to
   - ~zt~ scroll to top
   - ~zb~ scroll to bottom
   - ~zz~ scroll to center
