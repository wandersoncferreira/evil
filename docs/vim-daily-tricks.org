1. Combine d, c, or y with ~/~ to operate on text up until a ~pattern~ match:
   | example | description                          |
   |---------+--------------------------------------|
   | d/foo   | delete forward untill ~foo~          |
   | c/\d    | change forward until the next number |

2. navigate more efficiently by using jumps
   - ~ctrl-o~ moves backwards through the jump list
   - ~ctrl-i~ moves forwards through the jump list
