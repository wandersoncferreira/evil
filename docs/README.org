#+TITLE: Learning Doom and Vim

Vim is fundammentally built on command composability. It favors small,
general-purpose commands that can be combined with objects to compose larger
commands.

This philosophy of minimalist commands that can be composed together is the
fundamental originating philosophy of Unix, and Vim exemplifies it like no other
editor.

You know what improves productivity? Mastering motions and operators.

Let's dive into it.

* Works in Vim, but seems not to work on Doom [1/5]
- [ ] Global marks are preserved between sessions in Vim
- [ ] :help <doc-entry> Vim docs not available :/
- [ ] :changes doesn't work
- [X] =[I= show lines with matching word under cursor
  - now, this binding will call =+vertico/search-symbol-at-point= function which
    is an improvement over Vim's default behavior due to interactivity
- [ ] ='[=, and =']= does not work. Marks preset by Vim to jump to last yank/changed text
