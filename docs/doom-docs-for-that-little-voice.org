#+title: Doom Docs For That Little Voice

* Documentation for that little voice on your shoulder!

I fear not knowing what is installed *my* Emacs instance.

This is definitely bothering me on Doom Emacs now, but before going to the
self-degradation route of "do-it-yourself because you can", let me try
something new.

I will document every aspect of Doom installed packages. My goal is to get
familiar with what is around. Therefore, if I am unsure about
what a package does or if I want to keep it or not then just *remove it*.

The current statuses for each package are:

| Status | Meaning                                             |
|--------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| ✅     | package kept                                        |
| ❌     | package removed                                     |
| ⚠️     | package removed, but under consideration            |
| ☑️     | package kept, something broke on removal            |
| 💠     | package kept, hard dependency of some other package |


** Doom CORE
Doom is basically broken down into ~core~ and ~modules~ at a very high level.
All the code in ~core~ are related to sane defaults, Doom's foundation on
package management, projects, and a feel more pieces.

- [✅️️] [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/core/core-editor.el#L429][better-jumper]]
  - I felt the difference in my first day working without this package.
  - The package seems pretty nice and the functionality is important to daily
    usage when coding. Jumping back and forth a definition is not as reliable
    without this package.

** Doom MODULES
*** vertico
- [✅] [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]]
- [✅] [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]]
  - It is possible to live without orderless and configuring ~completion-styles~
    option to consider ~partial-completion~ and ~flex~, however ~orderless~
    is a lot faster. Let's keep it around.
  - Amazing! I learned how to use ~orderless~ in company completion UI.
    As ~SPC~ takes us out of completion, let's use ~&~ as the separator.
  - The separator also works with ~corfu~ now that I ditched ~company~ for a while
- [☑️] consult
  - Project search via ~SPC /~ was broken 
- [⚠️] consult-dir
- [⚠️] consult-flycheck
- [⚠️] embark
- [⚠️] embark-consult
- [⚠️] consult-dir
- [✅️] wgrep
  - wgrep allows you to edit a grep buffer and apply those changes to the
    file buffer like ~sed~ interactively. No need to learn sed script, just
    learn Emacs
  - example of workflow:
    - ~projectile-grep~
    - ~i~
    - ~:s/<pattern>/<new-pattern>/g~
    - ~ZZ~
- [✅] marginalia
  - This is useful because as there is a bug with ~uniquify~ and ~persp-mode~
     used for workspaces, then I can't really know the difference for several
     buffers opened with the same name. Therefore, marginalia adds sufficient
     annotation to make this way better.

*** doom
- [❌] doom-themes
- [❌] solaire-mode

*** popup
Very amazing package developed by Doom team. I'm very interested in digging
deeper here. Taming popup has been one of my worst skills in Emacs.

I enabled ~+all~ special buffers to be handled as popups. Very optimistic about this.

*** vc-gutter
- [✅️] git-gutter-fringe

*** hl-todo
- [❌️] hl-todo

*** workspaces
- [✅] persp-mode
  - I added a couple of modifications to include special buffers
    from project to the enabled workspace at the time

*** evil
Module responsible for bringing Vim over to the party.
- [✅] evil
  - There are some dependencies required by ~evil~ stated in their README page:
  - Evil requires any of the following for ~C-r~
    - [✅] [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/emacs/undo/config.el#L3][undo-fu]]
    - However, Doom also uses undo-fu-session to save/restore undo history. I'm not interested in this.
      - [❌] [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/emacs/undo/config.el#L27][undo-fu-session]]
- [⚠️] evil-args
- [⚠️] evil-easymotion
- [⚠️] evil-embrace
- [✅] evil-escape
- [✅️] evil-exchange
  - I'm extremely happy I'm going through all of this! What a nice package!!!
  - [[http://vimcasts.org/episodes/swapping-two-regions-of-text-with-exchange-vim/][learn more about this here]]
  - be aware that in Doom the keybinding is bound to ~gx~ instead of ~cx~ as in vim-exchange. Yeah, the way evil works... this is a gem!
- [⚠️] evil-indent-plus
- [⚠️] evil-lion
- [✅️] evil-nerd-commenter
  - Comment code efficiently!
- [❌️] evil-numbers
  - :/ I think I never had to increase/decrease numbers by unit before
- [⚠️] evil-snipe
- [✅️] evil-surround
  - I use this plugin everytime! I'm not using smartparens to handle surrounding.
  - Actually, I use ~add surrounding~ (~yS<textobject>~) a lot but not the next ones:
    - change surrounding: ~cs<old-textobject><new-textobject>~
    - delete surrounding: ~ds<textobject>~
- [⚠️] evil-textobj-anyblock
- [✅️] evil-traces
  - It's useful to visualize the output of some commands before applying it
  - I'm not so good at Ex commands in Vim, so I generally like visual hints that I'm not doing something wrong.
- [❌️️] evil-visualstar
  - Didn't see any improvement in the behavior of plain ~*~ or ~#~
  - tbh, I think I'm not a power user of Visual mode so I don't see the benefit here.
- [⚠️] exato
- [⚠️] evil-quick-diff
- [✅] evil-collection

*** file-templates
- [✅] yasnippet

*** multiple-cursors
- [⚠] evil-multiedit
- [⚠️️] evil-mc
- [⚠️️] multiple-cursors

*** snippets
- [✅] yasnippet
- [⚠️️] auto-yasnippet
- [⚠️️] doom-snippets

*** dired
- [❌] diredfl
- [✅️] dired-git-info
  - This is nice specially because it comes disabled and I can toggle using ~)~ in Dired buffer
  - However, I'm still having double thoughts about its usefulness...
    I never needed this feature, but who knows now that I'm aware of it
- [❌] diff-hl
- [❌] fd-dired
- [❌] dired-rsync

*** electric
No external package! Small customization from Doom also.

*** vc
- [💠] browse-at-remote
  - After removing the package, Doom didn't startup correctly.
-️️ [⚠️️] git-commit
- [✅] git-timemachine
- [⚠] git-modes

*** undo
These packages are required by ~evil~ in order to enable ~evil-redo~ (~Ctrl-r~) properly.
 - [✅] [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/emacs/undo/config.el#L3][undo-fu]]
   - Simple, stable linear undo with redo for Emacs.
   - Changes compared to Emacs undo:
     - Redo will not pass the initial undo action
     - Redo winn not undo
     - These constraints can be disabled by pressing ~C-g~ before undo or redo.
   - Doom increases the undo-limit, I'd like to revert that to defaults.
     Look for the default values at ~preferences/+doom.el~
 - [❌] [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/emacs/undo/config.el#L27][undo-fu-session]]

  - I'm the maintainer, so yeah! I should use it.
*** macos
- [❌] ns-auto-titlebar
- [❌] osx-trash

*** clojure
- [✅] clojure-mode
- [✅] clj-refactor
- [✅] cider
  - reading its documentation always teaches me something new
  - I could not make the fuzzy completion work with CIDER.
    The instructions from CIDER docs didn't work

* The little voice is getting louder...

Yeap, now it's time for the keybindings. Some modes add lots of bindigs with
custom functions and whatnot.

Let's start documenting a few obvious ones:

| keybinding | description          |
|------------+----------------------|
| spc + ret  | jump to bookmark     |
| spc + spc  | find file in project |
| spc + y    | kill-ring history    |
| spc + ~    | toggle last popup    |


All the disabled values can be found [[https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/evil/blob/main/preferences/%2Bdoom.el#L97][here]].
