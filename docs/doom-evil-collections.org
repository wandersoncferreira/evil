#+title: Doom Evil Collections

* Rationale

Many special modes share the same set of similar actions. Those actions should share the same bindings across all modes whenever feasible.

** Motions
** Quitting (q, ZQ, ZZ)
In Vim, ~q~ is for recording macros. Vim quits with ~ZZ~ or ~ZQ~. In most Emacs special modes, it stands for quitting while macros are recorded/played with ~<f3>~ and ~<f4>~.

- Bind ~q~ and ~ZZ~ to ~quit-window~
- Bind ~ZQ~ to ~evil-quit~

** Refreshing / Reverting (gr)
- ~gr~ is used for refreshing in ~evil-magit~, ~evil-mu4e~, and more.
