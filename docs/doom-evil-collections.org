#+title: Doom Evil Collections

- Prefix keys: ~g~ and ~z~ are the ubiquituos prefix keys
  - ~g~ generally stands for "go" and is best used for movements
  - ~z~ is used for scrolling, folding, spell-checking and more

* Quitting (q, ZQ, ZZ)
In Vim, ~q~ is for recording macros.

Vim quits with ~ZZ~ or ~ZQ~. In most Emacs special modes, it stands for quitting
while macros are recorded/played with ~<f3>~ and ~<f4>~.

- Bind ~q~ and ~ZZ~ to ~quit-window~
- Bind ~ZQ~ to ~evil-quit~

* Refreshing / Reverting (gr)
- ~gr~ is used for refreshing in ~evil-magit~, ~evil-mu4e~, and more.

* REPL (gz)
If the mode has a Go To REPL-type command, set it to ~gz~
