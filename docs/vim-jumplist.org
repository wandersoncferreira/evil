#+title: Vim Jumplist

From Vim's =:help jumplist=:

#+begin_quote
Jumps are remembered in a jump list. With the Ctrl-o and Ctrl-i command you can
go to cursor positions before olders jumps, and back again. Thus you can move up
and down the list. There is a separate jump list for each window.

It's important to know what qualifies as a jump?

|----------+----------------------------|
| <n>G     | jump to line <n>           |
| }        | jump to next blank line    |
| {        | jump to prev blank line    |
| [{       | jump to begin of block     |
| ]}       | jump to end of block       |
| )        | jump to end of sentence    |
| (        | jump to begin of sentence  |
| ]]       | jump to end of section     |
| [[       | jump to beg of section     |
| H        | jump to top of window      |
| M        | jump to middle of window   |
| L        | jump to bottom of window   |
