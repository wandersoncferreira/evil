- Search under cursor

  You can search for the current word under the cursor by using the =*= and =#=
  commands in normal mode.

- Reinsert substituted text

  Using the =&= you can reinsert the text matched in a substitution
  run the following command to see the effect: =:%s/cats/"&"/g=

- Substitute capture groups

  You can dictate capture groups using escaped brackets in a search. They can
  then be accessed in the replacement using escaped numbers.
  =:%s/\(\w\) and /\1 but not/g=

- History of past searches

  You search for various keywords in your code. After a while you want to search
  for some of those keywords again but you don't remember them exactly. No
  worries. Just press =q/= and you'll open a small window at the bottom
  containing your searches. Navigate with =jk= and press Enter to repeat the
  selected search. Or just close that window with =:q=
