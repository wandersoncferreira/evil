#+title: Vim Marks

A *mark* allows to record the current cursor position, then later we can return
to it. They have one non-trivial problem, you can't easily see them while
working on your document.

- each file has a set of available marks identified by lowercase letters from =a= to =z=
- global marks are identified by uppercase letters

* Using marks

To jump to a mark enter an apostrophe ='= or a backtick =`= followed by the
letter where the mark was set.

Using an apostrophe jumps to the beginning of the line holding the mark, while a
backtick jumps to the line and column of the mark.

There are many ways to use marks, the following table summarize some of it:

| Command | description                                                |
|---------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| ]'      | jump to next line with a lowercase mark                    |
| ['      | jump to previous line with a lowercase mark                |
| ]`      | jump to next lowercase mark                                |
| [`      | jump to previous lowercase mark                            |
| ``      | after a movement, you can return to your previous location |
| ctrl-^  | send you back to the previous buffer that you were in      |
| d`p     | delete to mark =p=                                         |
| d'p     | delete everything including the line mark =p= is on        |
| y`p     | yank to mark                                               |
| `'      | jump back and forth between the last two jump destinations |
| `.      | jump to the position of the last edit                      |
| '.      | jump to the line of the last edit                          |
| `<      | jump to the start of the last visual selection             |
| `>      | jump to the end of the last visual selection               |
| '<      | start of visual selection                                   |
| >'      | end of visual selection                                     |
| '[      | start of last change or yank                                |
| ']      | end of last change or yank                                  |
| '.      | position of where last change was made                      |
| '^      | position of cursor when last time Vim left insert-mode (gi) |
| ''      | positon before last jump                                    |

Example of =``= usage:
- =/while<Enter>=  ;; jump to the first match of while
- =``=             ;; move back to start

* Seeing Marks
Without plugins you can "see" your marks by running =:marks= which shows you a
quickfix window that list all your marks.
