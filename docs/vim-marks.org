#+title: Vim Marks

A *mark* allows you to record your current cursor position so you can return to
it later. They have one non-trivial problem, you can't easily see them while
working on your document.

- each file has a set marks identified by lowercase letters from =a= to =z=
- global marks are identified by uppercase letters

* Using marks

To jump to a mark enter an apostrophe ='= or a backtick =`= followed by a
letter. Using an apostrophe jumps to the beginning of the line holding the mark,
while a backtick jumps to the line and column of the mark.

It's possible to navigate between lowercase marks

| Command | description                                                |
|---------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| ]'      | jump to next line with a lowercase mark                    |
| ['      | jump to previous line with a lowercase mark                |
| ]`      | jump to next lowercase mark                                |
| [`      | jump to previous lowercase mark                            |
| ``      | after a movement, you can return to your previous location |
| ctrl-^  | send you back to the previous buffer that you were in      |
| d`p     | delete to mark =p=                                         |
| d'p     | delete everything including the line mark =p= is on        |
| y`p     | yank to mark                                               |
| `'      | jump back and forth between the last two jump destinations |
| `.      | jump to the position of the last edit                      |
| '.      | jump to the line of the last edit                          |
| `<      | jump to the start of the last visual selection             |
| `>      | jump to the end of the last visual selection               |

Example of =``= usage:
- =/while<Enter>=  ;; jump to the first match of while
- =``=         ;; move back to start

* Seeing Marks

Without plugins you can "see" your marks by running =:marks= which shows you a
quickfix window that list all your marks.
