#+title: Vim Marks

A *mark* allows you to record your current position so you can return to it later.

- each file has a set marks identified by lowercase letters
- global marks are identified by uppercase letters

* Using marks

To jump to a mark enter an apostrophe ='= or a backtick =`= followed by a
letter. Using an apostrophe jumps to the beginning of the line holding the mark, while a backtick jumps to the line and column of the mark.

It's possible to navigate between lowercase marks

| Command | description                                 |
|---------+---------------------------------------------|
| ]'      | jump to next line with a lowercase mark     |
| ['      | jump to previous line with a lowercase mark |
| ]`      | jump to next lowercase mark                 |
| [`      | jump to previous lowercase mark             |
