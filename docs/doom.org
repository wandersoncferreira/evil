#+title: Doom

[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]] is a configuration framework for Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy
veterans who want less framework in their frameworks. Configuration is at the
same time the most fun and biggest challenge of any Emacs installation, Doom has
the advantage to be a sink for several hours of digging into very specific
corners of Emacs. Let's all leverage that.

*General recommendations:*

1. Use REPL and Eshell toggle functionality: =SPC o e=


*Commands:*

| Command      | Description                             |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------|
| jk           | get me out of INSERT MODE               |
| SPC sp       | search all files in the current project |
| /            | search within the current buffer        |
| ?            | search backwards                        |
| CTRL ,       | find next flyspell error                |
| z=           | fix wrong word at point                 |
| CTRL ;       | fix previous wrong word                 |
| SPC bl       | cycle between buffers                   |
| SPC RET      | jump to bookmark                        |
| SPC sj       | show me the jumplist                    |
| SPC w Ctrl p | jumps to the last window used           |

* How to perform project-search and replace?

- =spc s p= launch a project text search
- =c-;= to run =embark-act=
- =E= to run =embark-export=
- =C-c C-p= to run =wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode= to make search results writable
- =:%s/foo/bar/g= to perform a regular single file edit
- =Z Z= to write all the changes to their respective files or =Z Q= to abort search and replace

* Modules / Layers

Doom has several modules enabling different features across Emacs. This section
attempts to document the major functionalities I rely on in a daily basis

** Search

If you press =SPC= and wait for a few seconds, the =which-key= panel will pop
up. We can already see a couple of good search options, but the majority of the
search functionality is behind =SPC s=.

| Commands  | Description                                           |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC + *   | search for the word at point across the whole project |
| SPC + '   | resume last search                                    |
| SPC + /   | search in the whole project                           |
| SPC + s j | search in the jumplist                                |

** Project

Doom basic rely on [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] to handle all project related functionalities
under =SPC p= prefix.

| Command     | Description                                    |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------|
| spc + p + e | edit .dir-locals file from project             |
| spc + p + i | invalidate project cache                       |
| spc + p + t | toggle between project implementation and test |
