#+TITLE: Learning Doom and Vim

Vi is fundammentally built on command composability. It favors small,
general-purpose commands that can be combined with objects to compose larger
commands.

This philosophy of minimalist commands that can be composed together is the
fundamental originating philosophy of Unix, and Vim exemplifies it like no other
editor.

You know what improves productivity? Mastering motions and operators.

* General Notes

 - =^= go to the first non-blank character of the line
 - =g_= go to the last non-blank character of the line
 - =C-r= redo
 - =%= go to the corresponding (, [, or {
 - =*= go to the next occurrence of the word under the cursor
 - =#= go to the previous occurrence of the word under the cursor
 - How to center the current line in the screen in Vim?
   - zz, zt, zb
 - How to scroll down/up in Vim?
   - ctrl-d, ctrl-u, ctrl-b, ctrl-f
 - Try using the Toggle functionality more often to remove or bring up eshell or REPL
 - Nice day today! I just learned that pressing =jk= will get me out of INSERT MODE
 - =dot= will repeat the last command
 - completion works via =c-n= and =c-p=
 - =spc sp= to search all files in the current project
 - =/= to search within the current buffer. Use `n` and `N` to go to next and
   previous matches. =?= to search backwards.
 - =s= and type two characters to jump forward to the nearest match
   - if the things I want to jump to is fairly close to where the cursor is I'll
     use evil-snipe (s and S). If it's far away or in another window, I'll use Avy
     (gs SPC)
 - use =c-,= to find next flyspell error
 - use =z-== to fix the wrong word at point
 - use =c-;= to fix previous wrong word.
 - the "dot" command: think if the dot command would repeat your edition correctly
 - use the more general text objects (iw rather than w)
 - prefer text objects to motions when possible
 - visual mode is a smell
 - don't use two sentences where one will due
 - visual mode breaks repeatability
 - custom operators
   - surround
     - change surround <object>: cs
     - add surround: ys
     - delete surround: ds
   - commentary
     - gc <text object>: for example, gcip to comment entire paragraph
   - replace with register: TODO: verify if I want to include this plugin in my conf
 - custom text objects
   - indent
     - we can use =ii= to denote the indentation object e.g. gdii will comment all indentation
 - <verb> i <noun> is amazing
 - =ma= will set a mark in =a= register
 - =`a= will jump back to specific place of mark =a=
 - ='a= will jump to the beginning of the line of the specific mark =a=
 - =g;= cycle through recent changes
 - =g,= reverse direction
 - ='.= jump to last modification line
 - =`.= jump to exact positon in last modification line
 - =:s/search/replace= by default operates on the first match of the current line
 - Subtitute flags
   - The most common flags are probably =g= and =i=
   - =g= works on every match
   - =i= performs case-insensitive match
   - =c= prompts for confirmation of each substitution
 - =c-r= in insert-mode will make evil paste from a register
 - The =0= register is useful because it contains the value of the last yank
   - ="0p= will paste the content of the last yanked value
 - Using =[m= to move to the beginning of previous/current method
 - Using =]m= to move to the beginning of next method
 - =ctrl-o / ctrl-i= cycle through :jumps
 - =g; / g,= cycle through :changes
 - =gh=, =gj=, =gk=, and =gl= makes visual movements instead of logical
 - =M-d= will select the current word, and again will find another ocurrence
 - =M-D= will find occurrence upward
 - In visual mode you can select a word and =R= will select all ocurrences
   - =Ctrl-n= for next selection
   - =Ctrl-p= for previous selection
   - Exclude matches with =RET=
   - You can make an edit and the changes will be reflected in all the selection

* Works in Vim, but seems not to work on Doom [0/2]
- [ ] Global marks are preserved between sessions in Vim
- [ ] :help <doc-entry> Vim docs not available :/


* Learn the Mindset

Don't type it twice, is a pretty good summary of the Vim" Way" of doing things.

Think operators, text objects, and motions

* Vim Verbs

Single character verbs
| Command | Action                                                |
|---------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| x       | delete character under the cursor                     |
| r       | replace character under cursor with another character |
| s       | delete character under cursor and move to insert mode |


* Vim Text Objects

The second type of "direct object" that Vim verbs can take is a text object. You can think of text objects as a "defined chunk of text".

| Command | Text Object                                         |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| iw      | applies to everything in the current word           |
| it      | aplies to everything in current xml/html tag        |
| i{      | applies to everything inside nearest curly brackets |
