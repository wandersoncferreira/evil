#+title: Doom

[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]] is a configuration framework for Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy
veterans who want less framework in their frameworks.

- Use the *toggle* functionality more often to remove or bring up eshell or REPL
- Nice day today! I just learned that pressing =jk= will get me out of INSERT MODE
- =spc sp= to search all files in the current project
- =/= to search within the current buffer. Use `n` and `N` to go to next and
   previous matches. =?= to search backwards.
- =s= and type two characters to jump forward to the nearest match
  - if the things I want to jump to is fairly close to where the cursor is I'll
     use evil-snipe (s and S). If it's far away or in another window, I'll use Avy
     (gs SPC)
  - if you want to jump to other matches use =;= and =,=
- use =Ctrl-,= to find next flyspell error
- use =z-== to fix the wrong word at point
- use =Ctrl-;= to fix previous wrong word.
