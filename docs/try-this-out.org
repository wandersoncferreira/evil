#+title: Try This Out


First you need to clone this repository and rename it to =~/.doom.d=.

#+begin_src shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/evil ~/.doom.d
#+end_src

This will prevent Doom instalation process to create a default configuration for
you and use this =evil= repo instead.

Now install Doom:

#+begin_src shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+end_src

Keep in mind that Doom usually relies on =~/.doom.d/config.el= to change its
configuration. However, as you can see if you read the =evil/config.el= file, I
use custom modules for everything!
