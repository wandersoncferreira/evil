#+title: Vim Tips

Vim is fundammentally built on command composability.

Vim favors small, general-purpose commands that can be combined with objects to
compose larger commands.

- use the more general text objects (~iw~ rather than ~w~)
- prefer text objects over motions when possible
- visual mode is a smell because it breaks repeatability
- don't use two sentences where one will do it
- to avoid using Esc we can press ~C-[~ or ~jk~ in Doom
- history of past searches: ~q/~
- ~ctrl-^~ will send you back to the previous buffer you were in
